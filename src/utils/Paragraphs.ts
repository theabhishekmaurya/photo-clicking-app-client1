  `Child sexual abuse material (legally known as child pornography) refers
to any content that depicts sexually explicit activities involving a
child. Visual depictions include photographs, videos, digital or
computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor. These
images and videos that involve the documentation of an actual crime
scene are then circulated for personal consumption. More recently,
live-streaming sexual abuse has begun to surface. In these instances
individuals pay to watch the live abuse of a child via a video streaming
service. This type of abuse is incredibly difficult to detect, due to
its real-time nature and the lack of digital evidence left behind
following the crime.`,
  ` Though child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is a global issue, the United
States remains one of the largest producers and consumers of child abuse
content in the world. It’s important to understand the true nature and
pervasiveness of child sexual abuse material to convey the urgent need
to address this crime.`,
  ` Section 2256 of Title 18, United States Code, defines child pornography
as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor
(someone under 18 years of age). While the definition given above is the
proper legal term, it too closely relates this content to adult
pornography. In actuality, the subject matter of “child pornography” is
one of the most violent, horrific form of child abuse possible. For this
reason, those working to combat this type of abuse have begun using the
term “child abuse imagery,” one that more accurately describes the
content and is explicitly tied to the source of the problem.`,

  `Images of child pornography are not protected under First Amendment rights, and are illegal contraband under federal law. Section 2256 of Title 18, United States Code, defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor (someone under 18 years of age).  Visual depictions include photographs, videos, digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor, and images created, adapted, or modified, but appear to depict an identifiable, actual minor.  Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal visual depictions under federal law.`,
  `Notably, the legal definition of sexually explicit conduct does not require that an image depict a child engaging in sexual activity.  A picture of a naked child may constitute illegal child pornography if it is sufficiently sexually suggestive.  Additionally, the age of consent for sexual activity in a given state is irrelevant; any depiction of a minor under 18 years of age engaging in sexually explicit conduct is illegal.`,

  `Federal law prohibits the production, distribution, reception, and possession of an image of child pornography using or affecting any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce (See 18 U.S.C. § 2251; 18 U.S.C. § 2252; 18 U.S.C. § 2252A).  Specifically, Section 2251 makes it illegal to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for purposes of producing visual depictions of that conduct.  Any individual who attempts or conspires to commit a child pornography offense is also subject to prosecution under federal law.`,

  `Federal jurisdiction is implicated if the child pornography offense occurred in interstate or foreign commerce.  This includes, for example, using the U.S. Mails or common carriers to transport child pornography across state or international borders.  Additionally, federal jurisdiction almost always applies when the Internet is used to commit a child pornography violation. Even if the child pornography image itself did not travel across state or international borders, federal law may be implicated if the materials, such as the computer used to download the image or the CD-ROM used to store the image, originated or previously traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.`,

  `In addition, Section 2251A of Title 18, United States Code, specifically prohibits any parent, legal guardian or other person in custody or control of a minor under the age of 18, to buy, sell, or transfer custody of that minor for purposes of producing child pornography.`,

  `Lastly, Section 2260 of Title 18, United States Code, prohibits any persons outside of the United States to knowingly produce, receive, transport, ship, or distribute child pornography with intent to import or transmit the visual depiction into the United States.`,

  `Any computer user who has been found browsing porn or dating websites without having child porn filter commits felony under section 18C of Child Internet Protection Act. The felony comes with a minimum prison time of 18 months and fines up to $50,000. All the assets of the suspect is frozen during the trial period.`,

  `Any violation of federal child pornography law is a serious crime, and convicted offenders face severe statutory penalties.  For example, a first time offender convicted of producing child pornography under 18 U.S.C. § 2251, face fines and a statutory minimum of 15 years to 30 years maximum in prison.  A first time offender convicted of transporting child pornography in interstate or foreign commerce under 18 U.S.C. § 2252, faces fines and a statutory minimum of 5 years to 20 years maximum in prison.  Convicted offenders may face harsher penalties if the offender has prior convictions or if the child pornography offense occurred in aggravated situations defined as (i) the images are violent, sadistic, or masochistic in nature, (ii) the minor was sexually abused, or (iii) the offender has prior convictions for child sexual exploitation.  In these circumstances, a convicted offender may face up to life imprisonment.`,

  `It is important to note that an offender can be prosecuted under state child pornography laws in addition to, or instead of, federal law.`,

  `Child Pornography is a serious offense because we as a society do all that we can to protect our most precious resources, our children.`,

Federal Charges`,

  `Federal charges for child pornography will be brought for a variety of reasons.`,

  `One reason is if child pornography was brought into the United States, transported across state lines, between territories, or brought from Indian Country into a US state or territory.`,

  `Another reason could be that the buyer of the child pornography was imported into the United States, sent across state lines or US Territories, or from Indian Country into the United States.`,

  `Also, media sent through all interstate and international distribution channels, including mail and email, across state lines would be prosecuted federally.`,

  `The federal penalties for creating child pornography are at least 15 years in prison and up to 30 years in prison for manufacturing child pornography and distributing it across state lines.`,

  `A second conviction of manufacturing and distributing child pornography comes with jail time of 25 to 50 years in prison. All other convictions after your second conviction include 35 years to life in prison.`,

  `The federal penalty for distributing, selling, and/or intending to sell child pornography that crossed state lines or international boundaries into the United States is a minimum of 5 years in prison.`,

  `An individual could spend up to 10 years in prison and be fined for accessing child pornography on land that the Federal Government owns He could also get 10 years and a fine if he intentionally accesses or possesses child pornography through an out- of- state distributor.`,

  `More so, if the minor is less than 12 years old, the prison term increases to 20 years. If this was a second child pornography conviction, 10-20 years in prison is the punishment`,

  `As per the judgement passed by the honourable Cheif Justice Mr John Roberts,any victim which has been identified in the illicit images are eligible to get a compensation amount of 5000$.Since Jan 2021,there has been over 1,23,000 victims who has been benefitted from this judgement.This judgement was made considering various factors such as medical consultation and pills that used to cost over few thousand dollars.For all of these statutes, a child is considered to be anyone under the age of 18`,
